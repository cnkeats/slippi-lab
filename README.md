# Slp Viewer

## Ideas

### Replay Viewer

- Something wrong with facing dir sometimes (marth bair at least)
- Something wrong with 1-indexed animations (aerials at least)
- Something wrong with laser shooting animations
- Something wrong with Spacie UpB rotation (ex: straight up)
- Show Shield tilting
- Spacie throw lasers and deflected/countered lasers should be angled
- Spawn invulnerability effect
- Customziation (custom colors/colorblind colors, UI info)
- Fractional animations (Lcancel done, throws not done, any others?)
- Add characters, peach sheik at least. turnip throw animations... :'(
  - WebGL renderer with models??
- Actionstate/frame below % as option (stun/lag remaining too)
- Error messages
- Help/Settings (kb controls, what's not supported)
- Fountain platforms (infeasible until it's added to .slp spec)
- Wispy (seems infeasible until it's added to .slp spec)
- Separate project
- Team shade (ex: double fox has a light colored fox)
- Audio?
- Test canvas for individual animations
- Color by costume instead of port
- indicate CPUs
- Play/Pause button, other click controls..
- Speed up / slowmo (UP/DOWN arrows?)
- Electricity
- Game timer
- Frame count
- Missed L cancels?
- State dependent colors? (Invincible, hitstun, active)
- Fire for firefox, falcon stuff
- Inputs?
- Tests

### App

- Remove old viewer after reaching feature parity
- Find a domain
- Tests
- Fix VSCode complaining about json modules (resolveJsonModule=true makes
  tsc crash a lot due to json sizes)
- Render clip to gif
- Upload clip to some host
- adjust start/end clip
- Find clips within files
- Show results simultaneously? (ex: all 20 times you upthrew marth)
- Webworkers
