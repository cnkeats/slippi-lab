# Slp Viewer

## Ideas

### Replay Viewer

- Something wrong with facing dir sometimes (marth bair at least)
- Something wrong with 1-indexed animations (aerials at least)
- Shield tilting
- Spacie UpB rotation is not right (ex: straight up)
- Spacie throw lasers should be angled
- Spawn invulnerability effect
- Customziation (custom colors/colorblind colors, UI info, invincibility overlay?)
- Fractional animations (Lcancel done, throws not done, any others?)
- Add characters, peach sheik at least. turnip throw animations... :'(
  - WebGL renderer with models??
- Actionstate/frame below % as option
- Error messages
- Help/Settings (kb controls, what's not supported)
- Fountain platforms (infeasible until it's added to .slp spec)
- Wispy (seems infeasible until it's added to .slp spec)
- Separate project
- Tests?

### App

- Remove old viewer after reaching feature parity
- Find a domain
- Tests
- Fix VSCode complaining about json modules (resolveJsonModule=true makes
  tsc crash a lot due to json sizes)
- Render clip to gif
- Upload clip to some host
- adjust start/end clip
- Find clips within files
- Show results simultaneously? (ex: all 20 times you upthrew marth)
- Webworkers
