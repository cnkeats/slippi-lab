- Show game timer
- Customziation (custom colors/colorblind colors, UI info, invincibility overlay?)
- Slider to seek within replay
- KB controls (pauseplay, frame advance, +/- 3 seconds, fullscreen?)
- Slippi code/name below %
- Name tags
- Fox Up B rotation
- End of game
- Draw blastzone
- Backgrounds
- Zoom/Camera
- Facing issues? (eg. Marth bair, turnaround upbs?)

- Remove old viewer after reaching feature parity
- Get domain + publish
- Render to gif

- Find clips within files
- Search multiple files / directories
- Show results simultaneously? (ex: all 20 times you upthrew marth)
